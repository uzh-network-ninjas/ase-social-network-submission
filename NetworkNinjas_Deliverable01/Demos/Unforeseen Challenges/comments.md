# Report Sprint 1

During our initial sprint, we encountered several unforeseen challenges that have significantly impacted our project timeline and deliverables.

## Project Setup
### Original Plan vs. Reality

- Issues Identified: Project setup was omitted, delaying progress.
- Adjustment Made: Sprint 1 focused on establishing a working environment and implementing user registration and login, laying a solid foundation.

## Frontend Mockups
### Initial Oversight and Correction

- Issues Identified: Frontend mockups were overlooked in planning.
- Proactive Measures: Extra time because project setup delayed user stories allowed for mockup creation. We will include creating mockups in future planning.

## Planned Adjustments and Conclusion
We realized that sprints 2 and 3 are allocated more time than sprint 1. This discrepancy was initially overlooked in our planning phase. 
A sprint planning meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, 19.03.2024, to reassess and adjust our sprint plans.
